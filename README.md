# Npm2Mvn Spring Boot Example
This is an example Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to use Npm2Mvn packages in Spring Boot applications. 

[Npm2Mvn](https://npm2mvn.jadaptive.com/) is a bridge between NPM packages and the Maven build system. It automatically creates Maven artifacts (Jars) that include NPM modules so they can be accessed from the Java classpath. 

## Why Npm2Mvn?
Java developers often need to include Javascript from NPM modules in web applications (think Bootstrap, JQuery, FontAwesome...). Npm2Mvn's automatic artifact generation means that the NPM assets no longer have to be included in your HTML resources and can be served directly from the classpath.
